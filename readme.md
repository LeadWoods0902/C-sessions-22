# Mentoring Worksheet - C

Welcome to the first C mentor session!

To get a copy of this repo (so you can code your own solutions), clone this repo
by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeadWoods0902/C-Mentor-Session-22-11-02.git

```

The three tasks can can be found in the root folder of the repository.

Solutions are available in the solutions folder

### Getting More Practice

The best thing you can do to improve your skills in C (and programming in
general) is practice. These are some useful websites for you to try out if you
want to go further.

Try out the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) this year.

For every day of Advent (1-25th December) there will be a new programming challenge.
You can tackle the problems in any language and you don't have to use the same language for every challenge.
If you want to get some practice in before the big event, all of the previous years' challenges are still available.


There are many sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/products/main/) that can provide many challenges and programming tasks.
These are also brilliant samples for coding interviews


Try some of them out if you want to push yourself! Some of the mentors may be
able to help with these if they've done them before too, so drop a message in
\#programming on the Discord server if you get stuck.
