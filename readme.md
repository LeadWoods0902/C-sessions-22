<h1> Mentoring Worksheet - C </h1>

<h4> Welcome to C mentoring sessions repository! </h4>

To get a copy of this repo (so you can code your own solutions), clone this repo
by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeadWoods0902/C-Mentor-Session-22-11-02.git

```


<h3> Task Versions </h3>

There are three versions of each task:
- Gap Fill variety : Most of the code is given to you and you must fill in the gaps to make the code run
- Hinted : Variables are provided
- Pure : Nothing is provided outside of the task definition

<h3> Solutions </h3>

Solutions have been provided, it is not in your interest to look at these before attempting the exercises but they are there if you need help.


<h3> Getting More Practice </h3>

The best thing you can do to improve your skills in C (and programming in
general) is practice. These are some useful websites for you to try out if you
want to go further.

Try out the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) this year.

For every day of Advent (1-25th December) there will be a new programming challenge.
You can tackle the problems in any language and you don't have to use the same language for every challenge.
If you want to get some practice in before the big event, all of the previous years' challenges are still available.


There are many sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/products/main/) that can provide many challenges and programming tasks.
These are also brilliant samples for coding interviews


Try some of them out if you want to push yourself! Some of the mentors may be
able to help with these if they've done them before too, so drop a message in
\#programming on the Discord server if you get stuck.
